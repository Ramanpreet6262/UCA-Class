res.setHeader() is a native method of Node.js 
And res.header() is an alias of res.set() method from Express framework.

This two methods do exactly the same thing, set the headers HTTP response. 
The only difference is res.setHeader() allows you only to set a singular header and 
res.header() will allow you to set multiple headers. 
So use the one fit with your needs.
