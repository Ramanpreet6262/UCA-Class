// npm is node package manager

// when we install a dependency, we get package-lock.json and node_modules

// node_modules contains so many modules but we requested only 1 express
// this happens because express is dependent on some other module and that some other module is dependent on some others
// so it installed all those okok..

// package.json is configuration file

// package-lock.json contains info related to all modules in node_modules...

// in package.json 
"dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1"
}

this symbol '^' signifies that whenever someone do npm install you need to install any version of that dependency that is newer or
same as one mentioned after "^" symbol not older than that... This will allow our code to use latest packages even if we are running it after a year 


npm ci // ci -- continuous integration
// BY this it will automatically read package-lock.json
And when we use package-lock.json it will install same version of all dependencies even after 5 years
But this will ake your code quite obsolete
But this is used in softwares where we need the same exact version of dependency eg -- Billing Softwares..
