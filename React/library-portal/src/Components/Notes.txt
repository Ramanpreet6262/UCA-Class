If we need an api, we need to create it using node/express...
or some other tool

BUt if we don't want to code an api now.....
We can use some online utility providing a fake rest api for front end development

One such example is JSON SERVER....


We will install it as npm install -g json-server

-g flag is for global
and --save flag for adding dependency in our project or package.json file 

In latest version of npm (mine is latest too 6.9.0), u don't need to do --
npm install -g --save json-server
i.e. no need to write --save, npm will automatically do it for u....
Earlier it was necessary....



U need to make a file named db.json anywhere in ur pc after installing json-server

Then move ur data of books u added statically in ur react code to this db.json file...


then go to directory where db.json file is there, and run command--
json-server --watch db.json



method chaining... to be used in fetch with .then callbacks...


We can call api from our react code or simply frontend code using XHTTP request or AJAX call
But now more advanced or latest thing in this is Fetch API

We can use Fetch to call an api in our frontend code and on behind the scenes it does ajax or http request only....




asynchronous requests goes to browser queues which will be executed after all code is executed hierarichally...
Jaddon sarra code likhia hoea execute hogia, then browser queues da code execute hovegaa acc to jehri req queue
wich pehle pai hai oh pehlan chaleggi and then next one.....

setTimeout() function gives us asynchronous code....

this.setState() method can work as both synchronous as well as asynchronous...

this.setState() is by default asynchronous in nature and always works asynchronously
And also when react da kujj vi call ho reha hovve okok....
jehre events hunde ne onClick yaan hoor events eh vi asynchronous hi hunde ne okok....

It works synchronously when an event or method or anything is called which is of javascript but not 
modified by react i.e. something core in that case it becomes synchronous...
eg-- fetch api to call an api, in this case it becomes synchronous...

Te jadd aapan koi event call kitta eg-- onClick te othhe setState kitta aapan ne then it is not updated in state
as it is asynchronous par koi farak nahi painda sarra code challega then async code and then component will be rendered

But panga tadd paina hai je aasin console.log(this.state) laa taa in that event method after this.setState()
hunn this.setState asynchronous hai te eh chalia nahi so console.log purani state hi ho javeegi so to prevent this
thing we need to make this console.log also asynchronous and one way to do that is by putting it in setTimeout method
so this.setState browser queue wich pehlan hovegaa and issde piche eh setTimeout walla so pehlan this.setState chal javvega
and then setTimeout due to which console.log bilkul sahi hovegga as per our requirement...
